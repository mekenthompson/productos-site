# RFC: [Name]

> **RFC — ship-coupled delivery (optional shape, not a named tier; use your existing RFC/PR process).** One living document for a single ship-coupled effort. It does the work that used to be split between a PRD (the decision and the why) and a delivery spec (the constraints), but it frames everything around the **user's job**, not our internal launch. It leaves *how* open — solutions are the team's (and the AI's) creative work, not the RFC author's prescription. The durable home of the job is its [Job Spec](/productos-site/templates/job-spec/); this RFC is one ship-coupled effort against it.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Draft \| In Review \| Approved \| Building \| Shipped \| Archived |
| **Owner** | [Name] |
| **Approver** | [Name, role] |
| **Approval date** | YYYY-MM-DD |
| **Strategic lever** | [Acquisition / Retention / Expansion / Efficiency — from your strategy] |
| **Tracker** | [Link to project in your issue tracker] |

## TL;DR

Three sentences:
1. **The job** the user is trying to do.
2. **What success looks like** for them (and for the headline metric).
3. **The biggest constraint** the solution must respect.

## The Job

Lead with the customer's job. Not our feature. Not our roadmap. The job they're trying to get done.

> **When** `[situation]`, **`[persona]` wants to** `[motivation]`, **so they can** `[outcome they care about]`.

> 🔗 If this job has a standing [Job Spec](/productos-site/templates/job-spec/), link it here instead of restating it. The Job Spec is the durable home of the job — it outlives this RFC; this RFC is one ship-coupled effort against it.

**Primary persona:** `[Creator / Consumer / Sponsor — or your persona name]`
**Secondary persona(s) affected (if any):** `[…]`

**Forces around the job:**

| Force | What's pushing or pulling | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| Push (pain) | Current state hurts because… | High / Med / Low |
| Pull (attraction) | A new way looks better because… | High / Med / Low |
| Anxiety (switching cost) | Adopting feels risky because… | High / Med / Low |
| Habit (inertia) | They've always done it by… | High / Med / Low |

See [JTBD Guide](/productos-site/guides/jtbd-guide/) for the framing.

## How Users Fail Today

The struggling moments. Specific scenarios where the user can't get the job done, gets stuck, gets confused, or gives up.

For each struggling moment: *the situation, what the user is trying, what goes wrong, what they do instead, and the evidence we have that this happens.*

1. **Struggling moment 1 — [short name]**
   - *Situation:* …
   - *What the user is trying to do:* …
   - *Where it breaks:* …
   - *Current workaround:* …
   - *Evidence:* `[link to research, customer quote, support ticket pattern, analytics]`

2. **Struggling moment 2 — [short name]**
   - *Situation:* …
   - …

3. **Struggling moment 3 — [short name]**
   - …

> Three is usually enough. If you can name fewer than two struggling moments with evidence, do more discovery before writing the RFC.

## User Success Modes

What success looks like **from the user's perspective**. Not "we shipped on time" — what the user is now able to do, feel, or decide.

- **Behavioural signal** — User now does X without help / Without errors / Within Y seconds. Observable in product analytics.
- **Felt experience** — When asked, the user describes the experience as `[adjective]`. Observable in NPS verbatims, interviews, or support ticket sentiment.
- **Headline-metric movement** — Specifically, this should move `[headline metric]` by `[amount]` for `[persona]`. Measured at `[interval]`.
- **Leading indicators (≤ 2 weeks post-launch)** — `[signal 1]`, `[signal 2]` — early reads on whether success is on track.

---

## User Failure Modes

What "this didn't work" looks like **from the user's perspective**. This is the bit teams usually skip. Be specific. If we can't name how the user would fail, we don't understand the job well enough.

| Failure mode | What the user experiences | Root cause we'd suspect | Detection signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hard failure** | User can't complete the job at all. | … | … |
| **Soft failure** | User completes the job but is worse off than before (slower, less confident, more steps). | … | … |
| **Silent failure** | User appears to succeed but didn't actually get the outcome they wanted. (Often the most damaging — looks fine in analytics.) | … | … |
| **Adoption failure** | The right persona never finds or tries the feature. | … | … |

**Anti-patterns to watch:**
- *Looks like success, isn't:* `[e.g., increased clicks that come from confusion]`
- *Looks like failure, isn't:* `[e.g., usage drop because the user finished the job faster]`

**When to stop or pivot:**
- *Pivot trigger:* `[specific condition, e.g., "60d adoption < 20% of target persona"]`
- *Stop trigger:* `[specific condition, e.g., "no growth between 30d and 90d and CSAT regressed"]`

## Guardrails

What cannot break, regardless of how creative the solution is. These are the constraints the team and any AI agent must respect.

**Quality / principle guardrails** (see [Product Principles](/productos-site/guides/product-principles/)):
- `[Principle 1]` — must remain true after this ships. Check question: …
- `[Principle 2]` — must remain true. Check question: …
- `[Principle 3]` — must remain true. Check question: …

**Performance / reliability guardrails:**
- `[e.g., "Page load p95 must stay under 800ms"]`
- `[e.g., "Existing API contracts must not break"]`

**Trust / safety guardrails:**
- `[e.g., "No new PII collected without explicit consent"]`
- `[e.g., "Action must be reversible within 24h"]`

**Out of scope (we will not do this, even if asked):**
- …
- …
- …

## Solution Space

This is the freedom-and-constraint envelope. **Describe the shape of an acceptable solution; do not prescribe the solution itself.** A coding agent or a human team should be able to invent multiple valid solutions inside this envelope.

**The solution MUST:**
- [Required behaviour 1 — phrased as an outcome, not an implementation]
- [Required behaviour 2]
- [Required behaviour 3]

**The solution MUST NOT:**
- [Excluded behaviour 1 — why this is off-limits]
- [Excluded behaviour 2]

**Free to vary — design and engineering choose:**
- UI patterns, component composition, page layouts
- Storage, query patterns, internal data model
- Whether to add a new surface or modify an existing one
- [Other dimensions left open]

**Known approaches that might work** (illustrative, not prescriptive):
- Option A: `[one-line sketch]` — what it'd be good at, where it'd struggle.
- Option B: `[one-line sketch]` — …
- Option C: `[one-line sketch]` — …

## Evidence

Three bullets max. Link out — don't restate.

- `[Research doc title]` — n=X interviews, key insight
- `[Analytics dashboard / query]` — current baseline number
- `[Customer quote source]` — representative quote

## Bets & Risks

What we're assuming, and what would invalidate the RFC.

**We're betting that:**
1. `[Assumption 1]` — if wrong, this RFC is wrong.
2. `[Assumption 2]` — …
3. `[Assumption 3]` — …

**Top risks:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[Risk 1]` | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | … |
| `[Risk 2]` | … | … | … |
| `[Risk 3]` | … | … | … |

## Rollout

How we ship this safely.

| Phase | Audience | Flag state | Exit criteria | Rollback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Private preview | 5–10 trusted accounts | ON for opted-in | `[signal 1]` ✓, `[signal 2]` ✓ | Flag OFF, no data left behind |
| Public preview | Opted-in customers | ON for self-selected | Adoption ≥ X, no critical issues | Flag OFF, communicate to opted-in |
| GA | All customers | ON by default | Maintained for 30 days post-GA | Flag OFF, post-mortem |

**Instrumentation required before private preview:**
- [ ] Event: `[event name]` — measures `[which success signal]`
- [ ] Dashboard: `[link]` — covers headline + guardrails
- [ ] Guardrail alert: `[metric]` triggers if it crosses `[threshold]`

---

## Open Questions

Things we genuinely don't know yet, and how we'll resolve them.

- [ ] `[Question]` — will be answered by `[experiment / research / build-and-measure]` by `[date]`
- [ ] `[Question]` — …
