title: ProductOS
---
**A product operating system.** The method *plus* the automation and
agent-executable guidance — anchors, Job Specs, templates, skills, and an
operating contract — that make delivery *run*, not just advise.

ProductOS is the method. The working example in action is
**[switchroom](https://github.com/switchroom/switchroom)**.

> Augment the judgment, automate the delivery.

## Building got cheap. Judgement got scarce.

An agent can draft the spec, write the code, and run the tests before you've booked the kickoff. The bottleneck moved. It's no longer capacity — it's knowing whether the thing is right, and catching it when it isn't.

ProductOS keeps four things fixed while the implementation churns underneath: anchors, Job Specs, design loops, outcome UAT. Agents build fast inside the gates; humans own the gates.

**→ Start with [Agentic Delivery](/productos-site/guides/agentic-delivery/) — the verdict rule and the four parts.**

## The hierarchy

```
Vision · Principles · Invariants        three anchors (the why / built-well / never-cross)
        ↓
Product Spec                            per product — owns the job list
        ↓
Job Specs                               per job — durable, outcome-focused, UAT-verifiable
        ↓
RFCs / PRs                              ship-coupled delivery (not a named tier)
```

**Verdict rule.** A change ships only when it advances a vision outcome **and**
satisfies its Job Spec **and** passes every principle **and** crosses no
invariant.

## What's here

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| **`anchors/`** | The three anchors — `product-vision`, `product-principles`, `invariants` — and how to write each. |
| **`guides/`** | The OS method: `agentic-delivery` (the verdict rule + four parts), `jtbd-guide`, `org-as-an-api` (sequence the roadmap from joined evidence), `product-specs` (the RFC how-to), `strategy-as-code` (strategy as a versioned, diffable artefact with decision records). |
| **`templates/`** | The blank shapes: `job-spec.md`, `job-links.md`, `rfc.md`, `strategy.md`, `decision-record.md`. |
| **`examples/`** | Worked, filled examples: `strategy-example/` (Tempo — a fictional team-scheduling product). |
| **`skills/`** | Agent-executable skills: `create-job-spec`, `feedback-to-jobs`, `uat-ux-debug`. |
| **`AGENTS.md`** | The terse operating contract — read this to *execute* the method. |

## Start here

- **Run the method (agent):** [`AGENTS.md`](/productos-site/agents/) — the gate, the triggers, the reviewer checklist.
- **Write a spec:** [`templates/job-spec.md`](/productos-site/templates/job-spec/) + the [`create-job-spec`](/productos-site/skills/create-job-spec/) skill (it interviews you, then writes it).
- **Set the why / good / lines:** the anchors — [vision](/productos-site/anchors/product-vision/), [principles](/productos-site/anchors/product-principles/), [invariants](/productos-site/anchors/invariants/).
- **Run a design loop (agent):** [`guides/agentic-delivery.md`](/productos-site/guides/agentic-delivery/) — the four parts and the verdict rule.

## The worked example

**[switchroom](https://github.com/switchroom/switchroom/tree/main/reference)** —
real anchors, a product spec, and 19 Job Specs: the method filled in and
proven against a live UAT harness. When a guide here needs an example, it
points there.
