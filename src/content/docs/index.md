title: ProductOS
---
**A product operating system.** The method *plus* the automation and
agent-executable guidance — anchors, Job Specs, templates, skills, and an
operating contract — that make delivery *run*, not just advise.

ProductOS is the method. The working example in action is
**[switchroom](https://github.com/switchroom/switchroom)**.

> Augment the judgment, automate the delivery.

## The hierarchy

```
Vision · Principles · Invariants        three anchors (the why / built-well / never-cross)
        ↓
Product Spec                            per product — owns the job list
        ↓
Job Specs                               per job — durable, outcome-focused, UAT-verifiable
        ↓
RFCs / PRs                              ship-coupled delivery (not a named tier)
```

**Verdict rule.** A change ships only when it advances a vision outcome **and**
satisfies its Job Spec **and** passes every principle **and** crosses no
invariant.

## What's here

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| **`anchors/`** | The three anchors — `product-vision`, `product-principles`, `invariants` — and how to write each. |
| **`guides/`** | The OS method: `agentic-delivery` (the verdict rule + four parts), `jtbd-guide`, `org-as-an-api` (sequence the roadmap from joined evidence), `product-specs` (the RFC how-to). |
| **`templates/`** | The blank shapes: `job-spec.md`, `job-links.md`, `rfc.md`. |
| **`skills/`** | Agent-executable skills: `create-job-spec`, `feedback-to-jobs`, `uat-ux-debug`. |
| **`AGENTS.md`** | The terse operating contract — read this to *execute* the method. |

## Start here

- **Run the method (agent):** [`AGENTS.md`](/productos-site/agents/) — the gate, the triggers, the reviewer checklist.
- **Write a spec:** [`templates/job-spec.md`](/productos-site/templates/job-spec/) + the [`create-job-spec`](/productos-site/skills/create-job-spec/) skill (it interviews you, then writes it).
- **Set the why / good / lines:** the anchors — [vision](/productos-site/anchors/product-vision/), [principles](/productos-site/anchors/product-principles/), [invariants](/productos-site/anchors/invariants/).
- **Run a design loop (agent):** [`guides/agentic-delivery.md`](/productos-site/guides/agentic-delivery/) — the four parts and the verdict rule.

## The worked example

**[switchroom](https://github.com/switchroom/switchroom/tree/main/reference)** —
real anchors, a product spec, and 19 Job Specs: the method filled in and
proven against a live UAT harness. When a guide here needs an example, it
points there.
