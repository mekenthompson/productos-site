# Handling Product Feedback

Product Feedback is one of the most important inputs into product strategy. It's a unique perspective that can help shape the product direction, qualify opportunities, and delight customers when it turns into a feature request that gets delivered.

Not all Product Feedback will end up as a feature, but it is still important to continue to log and track feedback to help us find patterns and opportunities.

## What is Product Feedback (and what is it not!)

### Product Feedback

- The product is working as designed, but it's **not meeting the customer's needs or expectations**
- Highlights an opportunity to improve or evolve the platform
- Often a longer-term consideration — added to a searchable backlog for review and prioritisation
- Example: "Retry buttons don't cover canceled jobs, making it harder to re-run them cleanly."

**What to ask yourself:**
- Is this a limitation of the current product design?
- Does this reflect a gap between what the product does and what the customer is trying to achieve?

---

Product Feedback is different to Escalations / Bugs:

### Escalations and Bugs

- Something is **broken or not working as intended**
- The customer is using the product correctly, but it's behaving unexpectedly or incorrectly
- Example: "Retry button is visible but doesn't trigger a job restart."

**What to ask yourself:**
- Is this a regression or broken functionality?
- Would a fix restore the product to its intended behaviour?

Escalations should be submitted into your Support team's triage queue — in whichever issue tracker or support tool your team uses.

## So... what's the process!

All Product Feedback should be routed to a dedicated Product Feedback queue in whichever issue tracker your team uses. The exact routing is product-team-specific, but **the principle is the same: feedback enters one queue with one triage owner**. There are typically 2–3 paths to create a feedback item, e.g.:

### Option 1 — Directly in the issue tracker

1. Create a new triage issue in the Product Feedback queue.
2. Complete the feedback template (problem, customer, impact, evidence).
3. Tag the source (Active Prospect, Customer, or Internal/Dogfooding).
4. Link the customer record if known.

### Option 2 — Via your team chat tool

1. Use your chat–issue-tracker integration (most chat tools have one) to create a Product Feedback item.
2. Fill in the same template fields above.

### Option 3 — Via your Support tool

1. From a customer ticket, create a linked Product Feedback issue.
2. Ensure the customer is tagged on the new issue.
3. Keep the original support ticket open — Product Feedback is the *underlying* product gap; the ticket tracks the *customer's* unresolved situation.

## What happens next

- The Product Feedback will enter Triage and a member of the Product team will assess the request
- You'll be able to track Product Feedback as it moves through its review by the Product team — it's here where the Product team will assess value, link it to any existing feedback and/or initiatives already planned and in our roadmap
- Once Product Feedback has been reviewed it moves to an 'Assessed' state. It will remain here until it is prioritised against all other work in the roadmap and allocated to a team for delivery

## How to manage customers when they raise Product Feedback

It's important we manage customer expectations with their Product Feedback, showing that we value their input, but not committing to product changes or timelines.

### Suggested Language

- **Empathy with Problem Context:**
  "Thanks, [NAME]. I understand how [specific problem] is impacting your workflow with [xyz]. I've clearly captured the details and shared them with the product team to evaluate potential solutions. In the meantime, here's the best approach: [workaround]."

- **Acknowledging the Problem:**
  "Hi [NAME], I've recorded your feedback about [specific problem] and how it's affecting your work. This will help the product team explore solutions that address challenges like yours. For now, [workaround] is the best way to move forward."

### Avoid Saying

- **Vague Actions:**
  "We've raised it with the product team."
  "I've passed this to the product team."

- **Unrealistic Expectations:**
  "Wait to hear back from the product team."

### Why Avoid These Phrases?

Avoid statements that lack clarity or create unrealistic expectations about immediate action. Instead, focus on communicating confidence that the customer's problem is well understood and will inform potential solutions, without overpromising.

### Key Tips

- **Show Empathy:** Acknowledge the customer's situation and validate their experience. Work to deeply understand what the outcome or challenge is that they are facing, why the product currently does not help them with this and the impact on their organisation
- **Communicate Understanding:** Emphasize that their problem has been clearly documented, including its impact
- **Manage Expectations:** Avoid implying specific follow-up or timing unless explicitly planned
- **Offer Workarounds:** Provide actionable advice for addressing their immediate needs while feedback is evaluated

This approach ensures customers feel understood and confident in how their feedback is being handled.

### What happens when the customer follows up?

Customer 6 months later: *"What has been done on this feedback since I gave it?"*

- Don't say "Nothing's been done" if you can't see anything being done
- Put it back on product to share the perspective of what has been done in the meantime
