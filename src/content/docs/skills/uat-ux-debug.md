title: "UAT-UX debug: solve from the user outcome"
name: uat-ux-debug
description: >
  Debug a UAT failure or production UX miss from the USER OUTCOME, not the
  single bug. It is the user-outcome counterpart to engineering debugging. Use when
  a feature technically "works" but the user's job didn't get done, when a UAT
  scenario fails, or when something shipped broken because nobody exercised it.
  Runs the loop: failure → which job/UX goal it breached → is the spec
  under-specified or did code diverge → is there test/UAT coverage → what change
  deterministically delivers the outcome (proven across a fuzz corpus, not just
  the happy path). Triggers on natural phrasings including: "why did this UX
  fail", "debug this UAT miss", "this works but the user's job didn't get done",
  "understand the root of why this was a UX debacle", "did we actually fix the
  outcome or just patch the bug", "what's the durable fix here", "solve this
  from the user outcome". Part of ProductOS (KEN-56); anchors KEN-57 (job
  spec), KEN-29 (probabilistic UAT), KEN-60 (UAT coverage).

A failure is a **broken job promise**, and the bug is just its mechanism. If you
anchor on the bug you ship a point-patch and the failure class recurs. Anchor on
the outcome and the fix converges on the UX the job actually promised.

## Step 0: Severity gate (decide how much pipeline to run)

Classify the failure: **hard** (visible breakage), **soft** (degraded but
works), **silent** (metrics look fine; the real failure is invisible), or
**adoption** (user quietly stops trusting/using the surface).

- **silent + adoption** → run the full pipeline below. These are the
  expensive-to-discover ones and the ones that erode the product.
- **cosmetic hard with an obvious cause** → patch it + seed the corpus (Step 3)
  and stop. Don't ritualize.

## Step 1: Map the failure to a job-spec clause + UX goal (KEN-57)

Start from the **user-visible end-state**, not the stack trace. Name the job the
behaviour betrays, find the clause, then descend to mechanism *last*. Starting
from the trace finds the bug and misses the breach.

- What did the user actually experience / end up doing? (e.g. "got hand-fed
  shell commands by their own agent")
- Which job/outcome does that violate? Quote the clause.
- If the project has an explicit spec system, use it. (In switchroom: the
  `reference/` dir, with vision pillars + JTBDs + the three principle checks:
  Docs / Defaults / Consistency. A "no" on any check is a redesign, not a
  follow-up.)

## Step 2: Gap detection: under-specified vs diverged

The test: **does the spec permit the observed behaviour?**

- **Permitted / silent on it** → the spec is **under-specified** → the result is
  a proposed spec clause. *Absence of a clause is a first-class finding*: it's
  the most common case and the dangerous one (silence is exactly what let the
  failure ship). Don't treat "there's no clause" as a dead end; it's the output.
- **Forbidden but done anyway** → the implementation **diverged** → code fix.

A single failure is often **both** (a missing clause AND a code bug). Classify
each finding separately; they get different fixes (spec edit vs code change).

## Step 3: UAT coverage + corpus seed (KEN-60 / KEN-29)

- Is there a UAT scenario for this **outcome**? If not, the feature shipped
  unexercised. Propose one (assert the outcome, not just "no error").
- **Seed the fuzz corpus from the failure CLASS, not the instance.** Identify
  the dimensions that vary (latency, retries, double-fire, ordering, partial
  failure) and the invariants that must always hold (exactly-once, always
  reaches a terminal state, never silently degrades). Encode them as a property
  test over the corpus so the class can't silently recur.
- If you bound coverage (top-N, sampling, no-retry), **say so**. Silent
  truncation reads as "covered everything."

## Step 4: Solve from the outcome, not the point bug

Propose the change that makes the **outcome** deterministic. Then apply the
arbiter:

:::note
**The fuzz corpus is the arbiter of "outcome-fixed" vs "bug-patched."**
A change is outcome-true only if the UAT-for-the-outcome passes ACROSS the
corpus, not just the happy path. If your patch is green on the happy path but
the corpus still breaks an invariant, you patched the bug. You didn't solve
the outcome.
:::

Common tell: the one-line fix (bump a timeout, add a retry) clears the reported
symptom but leaves an invariant (idempotency, ordering, terminal-state)
unprotected. Add what the corpus demands.

## Output

Report, in this order:
1. **The breached job promise** (one line: the UX, not the bug).
2. **Root cause(s)**, each tagged `spec-gap` or `code-divergence`, with
   `file:line`.
3. **Coverage**: the missing UAT scenario + the corpus seed (dimensions +
   invariants).
4. **The outcome-true fix**, and an explicit note on why the obvious
   point-patch is insufficient (which invariant it leaves open).

## Worked example: klanker `config_propose_edit` (switchroom, 2026-06-15)

**Breached promise:** "change config from Telegram, operator just taps Approve,
no host CLI." Observed end-state: the agent hand-fed the operator
`sed … && switchroom apply`. The promise inverted into nothing-but-SSH.
Classification: **silent** (metrics green: hostd logged nothing, gateway logged
`status=ok`; the only signal was the agent's confused narration) + **adoption**
(burn the operator once and they go back to SSH forever). → full pipeline.

**Step 1:** violates "you hold the leash" (control from Telegram) and fails the
Docs + Defaults principle checks (needed to know the yaml path and `sed`).

**Step 2, both:**
- *spec-gap*: nothing specified the agent-side contract while an approval is
  pending (must get a "card posted" ack it can see; must not re-fire; proposals
  must be idempotent; on infra failure say "I can't, here's why," never
  silently downgrade to SSH). The silence WAS the failure mode.
- *code-divergence*: the agent MCP wire used a flat 10s for an op that blocks
  server-side up to 10 min awaiting the tap (`src/mcp/hostd/server.ts`); timed
  out by construction, while the web path used 11 min and masked it.

**Step 3:** no UAT for the outcome (it was deferred as "needs the approval
card"). Corpus seed = {approval verdict × re-fire burst size × operator tap
latency}; invariants = exactly-once apply, every caller terminal, never
double-write. Encoded as a 60-schedule property test.

**Step 4:** point-patch (10s → 11 min) passes the happy path but the corpus
double-fire still double-writes → not outcome-true. The outcome-true fix added
**idempotent proposals** (collapse identical in-flight proposals → exactly-once
apply) on top of the per-op timeout. Shipped as switchroom PR #2381.
