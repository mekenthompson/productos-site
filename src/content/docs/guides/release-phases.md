# Release Phases

A feature doesn't go from "built" to "everyone" in one step. It moves through
named **release phases**, each with a defined **audience**, **flag state**,
and **entry / exit criteria**. Every feature ships behind a flag, so every
phase is reversible: if something breaks, the flag goes off.

This is tracker-agnostic — the phase names are what matter, not the tool.
Release phase is *how widely it's on*; it's distinct from the work's
**stakes / [path](/productos-site/playbook/decision-framework/)**, which drive *how much GTM
investment, approval depth, and gate rigour* the release gets.

## The phases

### 0. Behind the flag (internal)

- **Audience:** the dev team only (internal override).
- **Flag:** OFF.
- **Purpose:** build and test in a production environment without exposing
  anything. Wire up instrumentation here — events, dashboards, guardrail
  metrics — *before* anyone outside sees it.
- **Exit:** the outcome UAT passes (the user's job is validated end-to-end,
  job × surface, independent of unit tests) and production-readiness is met
  to the stakes. See [Agentic Delivery](/productos-site/guides/agentic-delivery/).

### 1. Private Preview

- **Audience:** 5–10 trusted customer accounts (hand-picked, friendly).
- **Flag:** ON for those specific accounts.
- **Purpose:** real feedback from real users on the real path, with low blast
  radius. Fix critical bugs, watch production stability, confirm the outcome
  holds outside the building.
- **Exit:** private-preview feedback summarised, critical tickets resolved,
  stability holding → the **Launch Readiness Check** gate (below).

### 2. Public Preview

- **Audience:** a percentage of customers, or opted-in / self-selected ones.
- **Flag:** ON for the preview cohort.
- **Purpose:** test at scale before committing to everyone — load, edge
  cases, adoption signal, support volume. This is where you learn whether it
  works for a broad base, not just friendly accounts.
- **Exit:** adoption and stability thresholds met, no critical issues, GA
  sign-off.

### 3. General Availability (GA)

- **Audience:** all customers (often via a gradual % ramp).
- **Flag:** ON for all (still disable-able).
- **Purpose:** full rollout, announced. The feature is now the default.
- **After GA:** maintain the flag for a stabilisation window; run the
  [post-launch reviews](/productos-site/playbook/delivery-standards/#post-ship-reviews) at 2 weeks /
  30 days / 60–90 days and make the explicit call (accelerate / iterate /
  pivot / investigate / stop).

## Audience + flag state, at a glance

| Phase | Flag state | Who can access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Behind the flag | OFF (internal override) | Dev team only | Build + test in production |
| **Private Preview** | ON for specific accounts | 5–10 trusted customers | Feedback from friendly users, low blast radius |
| **Public Preview** | ON for a % / opted-in | Preview cohort | Test at scale before GA |
| **GA** | ON for all (or gradual %) | All customers | Full rollout, still disable-able |

## The gate between private and wider release

Moving past Private Preview is a real checkpoint — the **Launch Readiness
Check**. Don't widen the audience until:

- the feature is deployed behind a flag in production,
- the **outcome UAT** is complete (the user's job is proven end-to-end), and
  **production-readiness** is validated (security / reliability / scale /
  availability, to the stakes) — two distinct gates, neither implies the
  other,
- success metrics are instrumented and guardrail metrics identified,
- private-preview feedback is summarised and critical tickets resolved.

Gate depth scales with the stakes. Full gate detail: [Delivery Standards →
Gates](/productos-site/playbook/delivery-standards/#gates-and-approvals).

## Rollback

Every phase is behind a flag, so the rollback is always the same: **turn the
flag off.** No data should be left in a broken state by a phase transition;
prefer changes that are reversible within the phase.
